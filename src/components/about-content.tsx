            A yearbook is not just a collection of photos and names—it’s a time
            capsule of unforgettable moments, friendships, and achievements that
            define your journey. It captures the late-night coding marathons,
            thrilling project successes, endless brainstorming sessions, birthday
            bashes, and the camaraderie that made it all worthwhile. It’s a
            tribute to the challenges you conquered, the knowledge you gained,
            and most importantly, the friends you made along the way, and the
            memories you created along the way. Years from now, when you flip
            through its pages, it won’t just remind you of what you studied, but
            of the people, experiences, and lessons that shaped your future.
